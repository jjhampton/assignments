## Description

This assignment serves to reinforce JS fundamentals with `setInterval`, writing to the DOM, practicing CSS animations, positions, and transforms, and finally breaking down complex problems into simple sequences in code.

## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

* Have mastery of general JS syntax
* Be able to write a series of functions that achieve a series of steps
* Understand arrays and loops, Math oeprations, Stirng operations, and DOM accessores
* Be able to recite the meaning and importance of SOLID principles
* Be able to breakdown a simple process of mathematical steps into a series of statements in JS

### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to effectively use:

* The install tools and processes given to you to build a site with SCSS and JS
* gh-pages
* SOLID code that is clean, readable, and testable

## Details

### Deliverables

* A repo containing at least:
    * The files provided by `npm install`
    * A `main.js` file that holds your JS

### Requirements

* No JSHint warnings or errors
* All functions should be complete and produce the expected output
* The clock should modify the colors of the background based on the time

Create a new Github repo, setup your project files, and recreate the following screencapture as a webpage.

### Tasks

#### Getting Started
  * [ ] Create a new issue with tasks
  * [ ] Create a new repository
  * [ ] Create a new branch based on `master` named `<initials>-develop`
  * [ ] Create and commit `index.html`
  * [ ] Push and open a Pull Request to `master`
  * [ ] HTML Boilerplate
  * [ ] Add structure using HTML
#### Make it Tick

  * [ ] Created and committed and **RAN** `main.js`
  * [ ] `console.log` the current time on page load.
  * [ ] `console.log` the current time every second.
  * [ ] Display the current time every second
  * [ ] Display the current time, padded with zeros to be exactly two digits
    long, every second.
  * [ ] `console.log` the percentage of a minute that the current seconds
    represents (e.g., if 30 seconds have elapsed, `console.log` 0.5)
  * [ ] Using the percent above, dynamically modify the length of the timer bar.
  * [ ] `console.log` a hexidecimal color that is based on the current second
    every second.
  * [ ] Dynamically update the background color of the page using the color.
